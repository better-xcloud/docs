### FAQ
- **Q: Why doesn't xCloud enable this feature?**  
  A: My guess:
    - It's not ready
    - It doesn't work with every games
    - More players = higher input latency  

    So it's understandable why it wasn't enabled.

- **Q: Local co-op doesn't work in game X. Can you fix it?**  
  A: No, only xCloud devs or devs of the game can fix it.
