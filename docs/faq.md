1. **Will I get banned for using this?**  
xCloud devs endorsed Better xCloud before and confirmed they ["don't ban people for using a third party client or extension"](https://old.reddit.com/r/xcloud/comments/1b5d4dl/new_better_xcloud_feature_play_local_coop_games/kt6w1wt/). As always, use it as your own risk.

2. **Why is it an Userscript and not an extension?**  
It's because not many browsers on Android/iOS support installing extensions (and not all extensions can be installed).

3. **Why doesn't the xCloud website implement *this* or *that* feature from Better xCloud?**  
Think of this project as an unofficial beta version of xCloud.  
    - **Better xCloud** doesn't have to worry about the compatibility much: if it doesn't work on this browser, it can just suggest you switch to another one. xCloud can't do the same.  
    - On the xCloud's side, they have a lot more users and devices to support, so it's more difficult for them to implement a new feature.  
    - Also, it's not easy to explain some of the features of **Better xCloud** to normal xCloud users.  

4. **Can I use this with the Xbox Android app?**  
No, you can't. You'll have to modify the app.

5. **Will it be able to request a lower FPS or increase the maximum bitrate (15Mbps) of the stream?**  
Sorry, no. The server decides all these settings.

6. **What's the meaning behind the name "Better xCloud"?**  
It's a reference to an Userscript called "better360" that I created many years ago. I regret not choosing the name "xCloud Enhancement Suite", or XES for short.
