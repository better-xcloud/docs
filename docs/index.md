### Third-party apps
- [Nexus+](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nexus/id6475538023) for Apple Vision Pro ([guide](https://gist.github.com/KhaosT/a4d90479e3cb0aae959ad55b08cd8358){ target="_blank" }, created by another dev [KhaosT](https://github.com/KhaosT){ target="_blank" })  


### Will I get banned for using this?
No, it's safe to use. xCloud devs endorsed **Better xCloud** before and confirmed they ["don't ban people for using a third party client or extension"](https://old.reddit.com/r/xcloud/comments/1b5d4dl/new_better_xcloud_feature_play_local_coop_games/kt6w1wt/). As always, use it as your own risk.
