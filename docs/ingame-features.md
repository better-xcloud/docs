- Similar to the "Clarity Boost" of xCloud on Edge browser. [Demo video](https://youtu.be/ZhW2choAHUs).  
- Affects the stream's performance, uses more battery, and may causes frames to drop (especially on lower-end devices).  
- Only works with Chrome/Chromium browsers.  

### Change video's ratio
Useful when you don't have a 16:9 screen

### Adjust video filters
- Brightness/Contrast/Saturation.  
- ⚠️ These features don't work when xCloud's "Clarity Boost" feature is ON ([#64](https://github.com/redphx/better-xcloud/issues/64)).
