# Install Better xCloud on Android Browser

!!! tip
    - It's recommended to try [Android app](android.md) first. Only use the browser method if you have performance problem with the app (especially on weak Android TV).
    - It's NOT recommended to use [Kiwi Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser) as it has been discontinued.

!!! note
    - I only distribute **Better xCloud** on GitHub, *DO NOT* download it on other websites or from unknown sources.

1. Install **Edge Browser for Android**
    
    [:material-google-play: Install on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.emmx){ class="md-button md-button--primary" target="_blank" }


2. Install the **Tampermonkey extension**  
    - Open Edge Browser.
    - Open Extensions manager > install Tampermonkey.
    - Make sure Developer mode is enabled.

3. Install **Better xCloud** script inside **Tampermonkey** 

    [:material-download: Install **Better xCloud**](https://github.com/redphx/better-xcloud/releases/latest/download/better-xcloud.user.js){ class="md-button md-button--primary" target="_blank" }

    !!! warning
        You must install **Better xCloud** as a script inside the **Tampermonkey extension**, or it won't work!

4. Visit [https://www.xbox.com/play/](https://www.xbox.com/play/)

5. Click on the new *< SERVER NAME >* button next to your profile picture to adjust the settings

# Troubleshooting

If **Better xCloud** doesn't work or you see a `???` button, that means you installed it incorrectly.  

You must install **Better xCloud** as a script inside the **Tampermonkey extension**, not as an extension. If you see something like this in the Extensions page, uninstall the **Better xCloud** extension and try again.

# Tips

![Tips](images/kiwi-browser-tips.png)

In **Kiwi Browser**'s menu:

- Disable the "Desktop site" setting.
- Use the "Add to Homescreen" feature to create a shortcut on the home screen that launchs xCloud as a full screen app.
