Don't see your browser in the table? If it supports *Tampermonkey/Userscript* then the answer is likely **"YES"**.

<sup>1</sup> It's NOT recommended to use Firefox as it's not officially supported by xCloud. Also its Gamepad API doesn't work properly so it might not recognize your controller.  
<sup>2</sup> Requires [Userscripts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887) (free & open-source). Check [this page](https://github.com/redphx/better-xcloud/wiki/Using-with-Safari) before using.  
<sup>3</sup> It's recommended to try [Android app](android.md) first. Only use the browser method if you have performance problem with the app (especially on weak Android TV).
