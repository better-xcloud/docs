# Install Better xCloud app for Android

!!! note  
    - This app is still in **early development**
    - Use this method for Android/Android TV/Meta Quest VR headsets.
    - I only distribute Better xCloud on GitHub, DO NOT download it on other websites or from unknown sources.

This app is a web app with the Better xCloud userscript intergrated.  

- Small size (< 10MB)
- Support all features of the userscript
- Better performance and battery life
- Support custom userscript


### Android app exclusive features:
- Better device vibration support
- Automatically limits screen's refresh rate to 60Hz
- Better Android TV support (soon)

The Android app doesn't support installing extensions. If you need this feature continue then using Kiwi Browser.
