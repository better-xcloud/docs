# Install Better xCloud app for Android

    - This app is still in **early development**
    - Use this method for Android/Android TV/Meta Quest VR headsets.
    - I only distribute Better xCloud on GitHub, DO NOT download it on other websites or from unknown sources.

!!! important
    - You're most likely to have problems with the stream if you're using a cheap device or a built-in Android TV. [Read more](https://github.com/redphx/better-xcloud-android/issues/41).
